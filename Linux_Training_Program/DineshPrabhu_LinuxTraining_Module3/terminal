Scenario: Automating file backup and Reporting to the system. Create a shell script called "backup_manager.sh" that performs the following tasks incorporating the concepts suggested.

Requirements:
1. Command-line Arguments and Quoting:The script must accept three arguments: Source directory: A directory containing files to back up. Backup directory: The destination where files will be backed up. File extension: A specific file extension to filter (e.g., .txt).Example:Â  ./backup_manager.sh "/home/user/source" "/backup" ".txt"
2. Globbing:The script should use globbing to find all files in the source directory matching the provided file extension.
3. Export Statements:Use export to set an environment variable BACKUP_COUNT, which tracks the total number of files backed up during the script execution.
4. Array Operations:Store the list of files to be backed up in an array.Print the names of these files along with their sizes before performing the backup.
5. Conditional Execution:If the backup directory does not exist, create it. If creation fails, exit with an error.If the source directory is empty or contains no files matching the extension, exit with a message.If a file already exists in the backup directory with the same name, only overwrite it if it is older than the source file (compare timestamps).
6. Output Report:After the backup, generate a summary report displaying:Total files processed.Total size of files backed up.The path to the backup directory.The report should be saved in the backup directory as backup_report.log.
