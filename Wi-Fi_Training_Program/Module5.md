## Module 5 -  Assignment

### 1. **Key Features of Wi-Fi 6, 6E, and 7 Compared to Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)**

#### Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac):
- Operates only in 5 GHz band.
- Supports up to 8 spatial streams.
- Introduced MU-MIMO (downlink only).
- Max throughput: ~3.5 Gbps.

#### Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax):
- Operates in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.
- Introduces OFDMA and uplink MU-MIMO.
- Improved efficiency and reduced latency.
- Max theoretical speed: ~9.6 Gbps.
- TWT for power saving.

#### Wi-Fi 6E:
- Extension of Wi-Fi 6 into 6 GHz band.
- Offers up to 1.2 GHz of additional spectrum.
- Less interference, higher capacity.
- Supports 160 MHz and 320 MHz channels.

#### Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be):
- Operates in 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.
- Supports up to 320 MHz bandwidth.
- Multi-Link Operation (MLO).
- 4096-QAM modulation (higher data rates).
- Extremely low latency for AR/VR and gaming.

### 2. **Role of OFDMA in Wi-Fi 6 and Network Efficiency**
- **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)** subdivides a channel into smaller subchannels (Resource Units).
- Multiple users can transmit simultaneously.
- Reduces latency and increases spectrum efficiency.
- Improves performance in dense environments like stadiums and offices.

### 3. **Benefits of Target Wake Time (TWT) in Wi-Fi 6 for IoT Devices**
- Schedules specific wake and sleep times for devices.
- Reduces power consumption significantly.
- Extends battery life of IoT sensors and wearables.
- Decreases contention and improves reliability in dense networks.

### 4. **Significance of the 6 GHz Frequency Band in Wi-Fi 6E**
- Provides additional unlicensed spectrum (up to 1.2 GHz).
- Supports more non-overlapping channels (e.g., fourteen 80 MHz or seven 160 MHz channels).
- Less crowded, leading to lower interference.
- Ideal for bandwidth-intensive applications.
